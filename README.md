# MEDICAL-CHATBOT-A-CONVERSATIONAL-AI-FOR-HEALTH-INFORMATION
This project aims to develop a conversational AI chatbot capable of providing accurate and reliable health information to users. The chatbot leverages natural language processing techniques to understand user queries and generate informative responses. 

The increasing accessibility of healthcare information online has led to a surge in user queries related to health conditions. However, navigating complex medical information can be challenging for non-experts. A conversational AI chatbot can bridge this gap by providing easy-to-understand and accurate health information in a user-friendly manner.
